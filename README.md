# Customer-Segmentation-and-Churn-Analysis

[Cricket Wireless](https://www.cricketwireless.com) is a leading Prepaid Wireless service provider in the US. 

As a part of my [Predictive Analytics with SAS](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/search/now/buan6337) course in UTD, I was exposed to their 7000+ rows of dataset containing details of customer data.

The goal of the project was to identify key market segments, analyze price elasticity of each segment and come up with customer retention strategies to reduce churn rate.
